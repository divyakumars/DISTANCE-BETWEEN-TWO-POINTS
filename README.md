# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: Import numpy into the editor
### Step 2: Input the co-ordinates to calculate the distance between them.
### Step 3: Substitute the values in the distance formula ![formula](image)
### Step 4:Print the solution.
### Step 5:End the program. 

### PROGRAM:

```

import math
d1=[4,2]
d2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt((d2[0]-d1[0])**2+(d2[1]-d1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```

### OUTPUT:
